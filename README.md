# Introduction:
I subscribe to the idea that an OS is never as fast as when its freshly installed. I therefore wipe my OS many times a year.
This repo and its scripts have been created to assist in speeding up the turn around time in getting back up and running. Currently this repo has two components to its structure.

1. A script which will bulk install applications I've deemed essential.

2. A script which will set-up symbolic links to a curated collection of dotfiles fitting my personal and selfish needs.

There really isn't a good reason for anyone (but me) to use these configurations. These files are alive and constantly shifting, the files become more abstract as their use increases and ultimately return to state of simplicity as my knowledge and comfort grows.
