# dotfiles

# Introduction:
Welcome to my dotfiles repo. This repo is a curated collection of dotfiles that fit my personal and selfish needs.
There really isn't a good reason for you to use them. These files are alive and constantly shifting, the files
become more abstract as their use increases and ultimately return to state of simplicity as my knowledge and comfort
grows.
